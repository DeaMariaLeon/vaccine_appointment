Robot in Python to check for a COVID vaccination appointment, available on Doctolib.
I had an appointment already, but I had to wait for several weeks.

This robot checks periodically for an earlier date than the one I had. 
It beeps when it finds one and shows the earliest available date.

Libraries used:

urllib
json
datetime
os
